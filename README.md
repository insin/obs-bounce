# obs-bounce

OBS script to bounce a scene item around, DVD logo style or throw & bounce with physics.

## Usage

Select the name of a scene item and press the Toggle button (or configure a Toggle Bounce hotkey) to start bouncing it around the scene.

Enable the "Start on scene change" option to automatically start bouncing when switching to a scene containing a scene item with the selected name and restore its position when switching away.

To enable changing color on each bounce in DVD Bounce mode, add a Color Correction filter to the scene item and the script will change its Color Add setting.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently only works for top-level sources/groups in a scene.
